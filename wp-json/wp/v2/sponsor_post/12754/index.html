The best way to build a security posture is to build it on top of transparent controls and infrastructure which can be observed, tested and enhanced. It is not built on promises from vendors which must be taken at face value.<\/p>\n<p>This means that the exact set of malicious activity and behavior you&#8217;re protected from should be known, and you should be able to test\/prove this. It also means that if you can describe something you want to detect and prevent, you should be able to apply it unilaterally, without vendor intervention.<\/p>\n<p>LimaCharlie enables security practitioners to maintain full control of their operations, while equipping them with the professional-grade tools and infrastructure required to keep the world safe.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"Heading-sc-1oornm1-0 liQyzH\"><b>Our Story<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>LimaCharlie was founded by ex-Google, ex-Chronicle, ex-Italian National Security Technology Center security and engineering professionals as an answer to four fundamental, yet unmet needs.<\/p>\n<h4 class=\"Heading-sc-1oornm1-0 gfwHgz\"><b>Need for Transparency\u00a0<\/b><\/h4>\n<p>Historically, the security industry has not been transparent to consumers or security professionals. LimaCharlie stands on the principle of full transparency and we believe this is what the security market of the future needs to look like.<\/p>\n<h4 class=\"Heading-sc-1oornm1-0 gfwHgz\"><b>Need for Control<\/b><\/h4>\n<p>Security professionals have been forced to either stitch their infrastructure from open-source solutions, build it fully in house, or rely on vendors to deliver on their promise. LimaCharlie enables security professionals to have full control over their security infrastructure that does not dictate how they do things, or force them in any direction.<\/p>\n<h4 class=\"Heading-sc-1oornm1-0 gfwHgz\"><b>Need for Scale<\/b><\/h4>\n<p>As organizations grow, it\u2019s no longer enough to connect multiple products built by different companies into one \u201csolution\u201d. To address the need for scale, it\u2019s imperative to be building for scale from day one &#8211; to think about latency and integration when you plan every single feature, and to do it API-first.<\/p>\n<h4 class=\"Heading-sc-1oornm1-0 gfwHgz\"><b>Need for Innovation<\/b><\/h4>\n<p>Security vendors often require a minimum number of endpoints and a multi-year contract before you can get started. LimaCharlie is democratizing access to security infrastructure by allowing users to get started with powerful tools and infrastructure for free, without having to do the capacity planning or put in their credit card.<\/p>\n<p>Whether you\u2019re looking for endpoint security, an observability pipeline, detection and response rules, or other underlying security capabilities, LimaCharlie\u2019s SecOps Cloud Platform helps you build a flexible and scalable security program that can evolve as fast as threat actors.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-12755 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/texascyber.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/limacharlie-300x90.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"90\" srcset=\"https:\/\/texascyber.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/limacharlie-300x90.png 300w, https:\/\/texascyber.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/limacharlie-1024x307.png 1024w, https:\/\/texascyber.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/limacharlie-768x230.png 768w, https:\/\/texascyber.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/limacharlie-1536x461.png 1536w, https:\/\/texascyber.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/limacharlie.png 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":12756,"template":"","sponsor_level":[10],"sponsored_year":[],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v21.6 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>LimaCharlie - Texas Cyber<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/texascyber.org\/sponsor\/limacharlie\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"LimaCharlie - Texas Cyber\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"Our Mission At LimaCharlie, we are building a world where people and organizations can realize their full potential without compromising security along the way.
